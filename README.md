Placecosby is a service that generates custom-sized placeholder pictures of Bill Cosby. :D

Inspired by placekitten and placecage. Not affiliated with Bill Cosby.

Here are some cool things other people have made:

- [Cosbynator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cosbynator/iedpdpjcpffoaliifbkpjgafakmcnadd) - a Google Chrome extension to replace all images on a page with Cosby
- [Luv Cosby](https://github.com/stuartdb/luv-cosby) - a Firefox Greasemonkey script to do the same

Special thanks to [Jonic](https://github.com/Jonic) for helping me land the placecosby domain.
